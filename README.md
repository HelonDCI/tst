# UIB-mqueries-movie-site

## Let's try to recreate this website

- You can choose whatever images/movie you want

- if you do this the same way I did you'll need to:

  - use positioning

  - change display types

- I used a pattern from here for the backgrounds: [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/)

- Images from [placecage](https://www.placecage.com/)
